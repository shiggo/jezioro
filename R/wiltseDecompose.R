#'@description
#'\code{wiltseDecompose} builds upon the Brien's test performed by \code{wiltseBrien} to identify homogenous and coherent subsets within a correlation matrix.
#'
#'First, a test for homogeneity and coherence within a correlation matrix is performed. If heterogeneity is detected (a homogenous matrix fails to reject the null-hypothesis for the tests of main effects, interactions and equal correlations), then the lake with lowest mean correlation within the matrix is deleted and the test is rerun on the reduced matrix. This process is repeated until the remaining variables are both homogenous and synchronous (i.e. fail to reject the null-hypothesis for the grand mean).
#'
#'To determine multiple sets of homogenous and synchronous variables within the data, the test must be run multiple times. Include all variables in the first run, and in subsequent reuns include only those variables previously rejected.
#'
#'This function is detailed in Brendan Wiltse's PhD thesis and calculates the grand mean, main effects interactions and equal correlation for the correlation matrix and returns the degrees of freedom, chi-squared value and p-value for each test. 
#'
#'@usage wiltseDecompose(my.data, print.detail=F, return.detail=F)
#'
#'@param my.data A data frame containing the variables to be tested. The variables should be arranged in columns with appropriate column names
#'@param print.detail (Defaults to FALSE): logical to indicate whether to display output from \code{wiltseBrien} for each step of the process. It is recommended that this is set to TRUE when first using the function to better understand the process of matrix decomposition.
#'@param return.detail (Defaults to FALSE): logical to indicate whether to return the full list output for further manipulation.
#'
#'@details \code{wiltseDecompose} A complete description of the Brien's test can be found in Brien et al. 1984, and the procedure for matrix decomposition follows the methodology described in Rusak et al. 1999
